					+faq('How can I help?', 'Digging highways takes commitment. You will be investing a lot of time into staring at Netherrack. It is usually best to dig with an alt account, or have a spare alt to use while your main digs. It is also recommended to have purchased <strong>priority queue</strong> for your account (we will not buy you priority). You must also make your way to a dig site on your own: we are not a charity and won\'t provide you with Elytra or any other gear.<br><br>If you are still interested, reach out to us in our <a href="https://meg.one/discord" target="_blank">Discord</a>. You will <strong>not</strong> be provided with any gear until you prove yourself to the group.')
					+faq('Are you the new IIS?', 'No. Many previous IIS members have joined MEG, but we are not the same.')
